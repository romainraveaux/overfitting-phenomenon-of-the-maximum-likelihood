Overfitting phenomenon of the maximum likelihood
===============	

# Introduction

## Goals : illustrate the overfitting phenomenon of the variance estimator found by maximum likelihood
## Requirements : Knowledge on probabilities (see my notebook http://romain.raveaux.free.fr/document/NaiveBayesClassifier.html)

## Author : Romain Raveaux
## Reference : The key concepts are presented in Christopher Bishop Book titled "Pattern Recognition And Machine Learning" more precisely from the section 1.2.4



# We start with some important recalls
